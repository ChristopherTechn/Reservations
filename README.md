About the Project
This project is a custom WordPress plugin that enables businesses to handle online reservations directly on their WordPress website. It was developed to streamline the booking process, reduce manual work, and enhance user experience with a responsive and intuitive interface. The plugin integrates seamlessly with WordPress, leveraging its core functionalities and extending them with reservation-specific features.
Features

Reservation Form: A customizable front-end form for users to submit booking requests, including fields for name, date, time, party size, and contact details.
Admin Dashboard: A dedicated admin interface to view, manage, and update reservations, with filtering and search capabilities.
Email Notifications: Automated email confirmations sent to users and admins upon booking creation or status updates.
Calendar Integration: A visual calendar for admins to track availability and prevent double bookings.
Custom Post Types: Reservations are stored as custom post types for easy management within the WordPress admin.
Responsive Design: The reservation form and user interface are fully responsive, ensuring compatibility across devices.
Validation and Security: Client-side and server-side validation to ensure accurate data submission and protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
Time Slot Management: Admins can define available time slots and maximum bookings per slot.
Shortcode Support: Easily embed the reservation form on any page or post using a shortcode.
Multilingual Support: Compatible with translation plugins like WPML for multilingual websites.
